  ### Prefix-Suffix" approach:

        Product of Array Except Self: Given an array of integers, return an array where each element is the product of all elements in the original array except for the current element.

        Trapping Rain Water: Given an array of non-negative integers representing the elevation map, compute the total amount of water that can be trapped between the bars after it rains.

        Maximum Product Subarray: Given an array of integers, find the contiguous subarray within the array that has the largest product and return the product.

        Sum of Subarray Minimums: Given an array of integers, find the sum of minimum elements of all possible subarrays.

        Number of Subarrays with Bounded Maximum: Given an array of integers and two integers left and right, find the number of contiguous subarrays such that the maximum element in the subarray is between left and right (inclusive).

        Count of Smaller Numbers After Self: Given an array of integers, count the number of smaller elements to the right of each element.

        Count of Range Sum: Given an integer array nums, return the number of range sums that lie in the range [lower, upper] (inclusive).
